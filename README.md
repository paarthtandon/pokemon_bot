# Pokemon Battle AI using Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains various experiments I conducted to train a Pokemon Battle AI using RL.
These experiments were conducted using [poke-env](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [Pokemon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/) for the environment, and PyTorch for model creation and training.

This repo was originally created for a final project in CS 687 at UMass Amherst.
The final report for this project is available in this repo (report.pdf).
This report contains more detailed information about the experiments that were conducted.
